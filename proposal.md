## Sources

I found nearly twenty articles about the neighbourhood in the *Sandusky Register* newspaper, which tell a story from the late 1950s to 1990s of EG's turnover from the federal government, establishment as low-income "slum" housing, and grassroots efforts to revive the area in the 1970s and 1980s using federal monies. All this information gives me an idea of the neighbourhood's "narrative arc". Particularly interesting were serious efforts in 1969 to start a neighbourhood credit union, which apparently did not get off the ground in the end, but would have been Port Clinton area's only neighbourhood-level financial institution. All the credit unions that currently exist in the area work at the regional level. The articles have detailed information about the residents' dissatisfaction with aspects of life in Erie Gardens, but also their tight-knit community structure and hope for the future. More recent efforts occurred around 2008 in an initiative called the "West End Conestoga Group". The name "West End" was intended to replace the moniker "Erie Gardens", which had long borne the imprint of the slum image. I still need to find the newspaper articles that will give me detailed information about these most recent efforts. Also of note is the critical role that the neighbourhood played in Mayor Vince Leone's 2009 campaign, where he actively courted the support of this often-neglected area of the city.

In addition to the primary sources, I'm trying to locate scholarly sources on federal World War II housing for a comparative perspective. This Columbia Master's thesis seems promising: https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D82J6K0G. Unfortunately I haven't read through it in detail yet, but I'm hoping it will shed light on the unique prefab architecture of this kind of housing. The sources listed in her thesis also appear relevant to my topic.

For the mapping component, I have collected historical property values for every parcel in the subdivision for 1991 (the oldest they have available) and 2018. I'm curious if there are any notable changes in the valuation over time. I will also collect the information for parcels just outside the neighbourhood to see if there is a sharp gradient once you leave Erie Gardens. For a second map, I think I can easily create a historical map of the street names and prominent community buildings of Erie Gardens from its time as federal housing. This would serve mainly for local interest, as I do not think many locals are aware of the former names.

## Background info (copied from previous submission)

My hometown in Ohio, Port Clinton, is a quiet fishing village on Lake Erie's
shoreline, with 6056 permanent residents and a summer influx of tourists. Port
Clinton is essentially a Northern Ohio version of Optimo, coming to prominence
in that republican moment as the local trade centre, decidedly non-suburban.
Even from a glance at a street map, however, one subdivision of Port Clinton
stands out as peculiar, a disruption of the otherwise regular city grid; this
is a neighborhood on the northwest outskirts, called Erie Gardens.

Nestled between two cemeteries and a major road leading out of town, Erie
Gardens' physical separation from the community is sharpened by major
differences in its look and feel vis-à-vis the rest of town. Port Clinton's
Original Plat is an almost perfectly square grid, and later additions to the
city basically extend this pattern, either with overtures toward suburbia with
larger setbacks (southwest Port Clinton) or the beach-village allusions of the
east side. But Erie Gardens is a foreign landscape to the lower-middle-class
ideal. Far from gridlike, with tightly interlocking streets, some of which wind
back in on themselves and other streets which are actually just poorly-kempt
sidewalks bearing the names of minor presidents like Polk and Garfield.

These streets are lined with rows of prefab longhouses, most of which are
divided between two or three apartments. This extremely affordable housing form
makes it the epicentre of Port Clinton poverty, with the attendant minor (mostly
drug-related) crime. All this is enough for parents to convince their children
early on that "The Gardens is pretty rough" or "don't hang around their at
night". Nonetheless, Erie Gardens has easily Port Clinton's most active street
life, with catch and bicycle races performed in the streets, the smell of grills
in the summer, and people chatting on their outside steps. Erie Gardens is the
Port Clinton equivalent of Boston's North End, as popularised by Jane Jacobs,
which "respectable" society had written off, but she realised contained the
recipe for strong community fabric with "eyes on the street" and the "sidewalk
symphony". I never understood the general disdain most of Port Clinton feels for
Erie Gardens (besides its own residents, many of whom are very fond of their
neighborhood).

Erie Gardens has a history unique within Port Clinton as well: company housing.
During World War II, the cheap housing was built to accommodate workers for a
local ordnance works about a mile to the northwest. Like the economical
construction, the streets were frugally named A, B, C…. The short-lived purpose
of the makeshift company village presumably became a white elephant following
the war, and real estate developers or local government responded with the
attractive name Erie Gardens, new names for the streets (A became Abbey Lane, B
became Bataan, C became Concord…), and turning the units over to the general
housing market. A local historian recently researched this transition process. I
would like to use her historical research along with property values and census
information to find how Erie Gardens developed a distinct social and economic
identity, an enclave within an already tiny city.

For the mapping component, which I'm signed up for, I am still considering how
to incorporate this idea into a historical mapping project. One thought is to
chart property values and demographic information over time to find trends.
Another is to reconstruct the street names and other features of the original
company housing development, which to my knowledge have never been
systematically compiled. As a personal project, I want to do some contemporary
mapping of Erie Gardens for OpenStreetMap, as its coverage on both OSM and
Google Maps is filled with inaccuracies, because many of the streets are too
narrow to be reliably traced from satellite imagery.
